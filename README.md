Description:
The Campus Network Design and Implementation project in Cisco Packet Tracer focuses on designing and simulating a robust network infrastructure for a fictional campus environment. This project demonstrates your ability to plan, configure, and troubleshoot a complex network using Cisco networking technologies.

Objectives:

Design a scalable and secure network architecture that caters to the needs of a campus environment, including multiple buildings, departments, and user groups.
Implement VLANs to logically separate and isolate network traffic based on department or function, improving security and performance.
Configure inter-VLAN routing to enable communication between different VLANs.
Configure network services such as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), and NAT (Network Address Translation) to provide seamless connectivity and internet access to users.
